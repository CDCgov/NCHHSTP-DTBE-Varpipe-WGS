  "description": "Depth of informative coverage for each sample.\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation is similar to the sample-level DP annotation, which counts read depth after general filtering, but with an extra layer of stringency. Its purpose is to provide the count of reads that are actually considered informative by HaplotypeCaller (HC), using pre-read likelihoods that are produced internally by HC.\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn this context, an informative read is defined as one that allows the allele it carries to be easily distinguished. In contrast, a read might be considered uninformative if, for example, it only partially overlaps a short tandem repeat and it is not clear whether the read contains the reference allele or an extra repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eSee the method documentation on \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id\u003d4721\"\u003eusing coverage information\u003c/a\u003e for important interpretation details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveats\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThis annotation can only be generated by HaplotypeCaller (it will not work when called from VariantAnnotator).\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eRelated annotations\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eDepthPerAlleleBySample\u003c/b\u003e calculates depth of coverage for each allele per sample (AD).\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCoverage\u003c/b\u003e gives the filtered depth of coverage for each sample and the unfiltered depth across all samples.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
