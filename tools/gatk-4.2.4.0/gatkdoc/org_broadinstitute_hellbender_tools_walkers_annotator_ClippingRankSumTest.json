  "description": "Rank Sum Test for hard-clipped bases on REF versus ALT reads\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis variant-level annotation tests whether the data supporting the reference allele shows more or less base clipping (hard clips) than those supporting the alternate allele. The ideal result is a value close to zero, which indicates there is little to no difference.  A negative value indicates that the reads supporting the alternate allele have more hard-clipped bases than those supporting the reference allele. Conversely, a positive value indicates that the reads supporting the alternate allele have fewer hard-clipped bases than those supporting the reference allele. Finding a statistically significant difference either way suggests that the sequencing and/or mapping process may have been biased or affected by an artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe value output for this annotation is the u-based z-approximation from the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test applied to base clips (number of hard-clipped bases on reads supporting REF vs. number of hard-clipped bases on reads supporting ALT).
