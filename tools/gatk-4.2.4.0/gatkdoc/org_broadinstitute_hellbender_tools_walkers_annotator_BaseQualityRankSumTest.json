  "description": "Rank Sum Test of REF versus ALT base quality scores\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis variant-level annotation tests compares the base qualities of the data supporting the reference allele with those supporting the alternate allele. The ideal result is a value close to zero, which indicates there is little to no difference. A negative value indicates that the bases supporting the alternate allele have lower quality scores than those supporting the reference allele. Conversely, a positive value indicates that the bases supporting the alternate allele have higher quality scores than those supporting the reference allele. Finding a statistically significant difference either way suggests that the sequencing process may have been biased or affected by an artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe value output for this annotation is the u-based z-approximation from the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for base qualities (bases supporting REF vs. bases supporting ALT).
