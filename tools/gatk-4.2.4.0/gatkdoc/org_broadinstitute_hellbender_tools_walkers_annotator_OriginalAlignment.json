This can be useful for downstream filtering if an alt\n allele has all or most of its support originally from a different contig. In the mitochondrial case this can be useful\n for filtering known NuMTs that are present in other contigs in the reference.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveat\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation can only be calculated if an OA tag is present in the bam and can only be run by Mutect2.\u003c/p\u003e",
