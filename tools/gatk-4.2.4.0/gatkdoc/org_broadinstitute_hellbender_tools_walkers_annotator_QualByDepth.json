  "description": "Variant confidence normalized by unfiltered depth of variant samples\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation puts the variant confidence QUAL score into perspective by normalizing for the amount of coverage available. Because each read contributes a little to the QUAL score, variants in regions with deep coverage can have artificially inflated QUAL scores, giving the impression that the call is supported by more evidence than it really is. To compensate for this, we normalize the variant confidence by depth, which gives us a more objective picture of how well supported the call is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe QD is the QUAL score normalized by allele depth (AD) for a variant. For a single sample, the HaplotypeCaller calculates the QD by taking QUAL/AD. For multiple samples, HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs calculate the QD by taking QUAL/AD of samples with a non hom-ref genotype call. The reason we leave out the samples with a hom-ref call is to not penalize the QUAL for the other samples with the variant call.\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHere is a single sample example:\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e2\t37629\t.\tC\tG\t1063.77\t.\tAC\u003d2;AF\u003d1.00;AN\u003d2;DP\u003d31;FS\u003d0.000;MLEAC\u003d2;MLEAF\u003d1.00;MQ\u003d58.50;QD\u003d34.32;SOR\u003d2.376\tGT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:QSS\t1/1:0,31:31:93:1092,93,0:0,960\u003c/pre\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eQUAL/AD \u003d 1063.77/31 \u003d 34.32 \u003d QD\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHere is a multi-sample example:\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e10\t8046\t.\tC\tT\t4107.13\t.\tAC\u003d1;AF\u003d0.167;AN\u003d6;BaseQRankSum\u003d-3.717;DP\u003d1063;FS\u003d1.616;MLEAC\u003d1;MLEAF\u003d0.167;QD\u003d11.54\n   GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:QSS\t0/0:369,4:373:99:0,1007,12207:10548,98\t    0/0:331,1:332:99:0,967,11125:9576,27\t    0/1:192,164:356:99:4138,0,5291:5501,4505\u003c/pre\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eQUAL/AD \u003d 4107.13/356 \u003d 11.54 \u003d QD\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveat\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation can only be calculated for sites for which at least one sample was genotyped as carrying a variant allele.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eRelated annotations\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCoverage\u003c/b\u003e gives the filtered depth of coverage for each sample and the unfiltered depth across all samples.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eDepthPerAlleleBySample\u003c/b\u003e calculates depth of coverage for each allele per sample (AD).\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
