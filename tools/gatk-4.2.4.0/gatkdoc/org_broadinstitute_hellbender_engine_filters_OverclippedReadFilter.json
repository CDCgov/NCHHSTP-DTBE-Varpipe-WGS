  "description": "Filter out reads where the number of bases without soft-clips (M, I, X, and \u003d CIGAR operators) is lower than a threshold.\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis filter is intended to filter out reads that are potentially from foreign organisms.\n From experience with sequencing of human DNA we have found cases of contamination by bacterial\n organisms; the symptoms of such contamination are a class of reads with only a small number\n of aligned bases and additionally many soft-clipped bases. This filter is intended\n to remove such reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eNote: Consecutive soft-clipped blocks are treated as a single block. For example, 1S2S10M1S2S is treated as 3S10M3S\u003c/p\u003e",
