The count of reads with MAPQ0 can be used for quality control; high counts typically indicate regions where it is difficult to make confident calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveat\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt is not useful to apply this annotation with HaplotypeCaller because HC filters out all reads with MQ0 upfront, so the annotation will always return a value of 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eRelated annotations\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eMappingQualityZeroBySample\u003c/b\u003e gives the count of reads with MAPQ\u003d0 for each individual sample.\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eLowMQ\u003c/b\u003e gives the proportion of reads with low mapping quality (MAPQ below 10, including 0).\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
