  "description": "A simple read filter that allows for the user to specify intervals at the filtering stage.\n\n NOTE: This class is intended to be a convenience method for the very specific case where a user might want to subset\n       a bam file by intervals but they cannot for whatever reason index/resort the file to be sorted by position. As\n       a consequence a file subsetted using this filter will involve reading over the entire bam input and will consequently\n       be very slow. The preferred method for subsetting a bam file in this case is to use the -L command to subset using\n       an index to avoid reading parts of the bam outside of the specified subset.",
